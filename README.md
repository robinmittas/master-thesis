## Master Thesis
This repo contains my master thesis and my thesis presentation. 

## Folder structure
The folder `/code/` contains all the code to reproduce the results. 

In `/code/scvelo/` the extended 'veloVI' model and multiple helper functions (plotting, imputation etc.) are defined. 

The folder `/code/nucleus_cytosol_velo_reproducibility/notebooks/` contains all the notebooks that actually create results and plots by using the implemented model.
